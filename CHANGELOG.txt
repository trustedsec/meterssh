version 2.0
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* Replaced reverse forward with regular port forward and reverse_tcp payload. This change removes the need for any special handler on the attacker's side.
* Added much more resilient error checking.
* Added ability to specify ip and port from command line.
* Added support of RSA, DSA (DSS), ECDSA key authentication instead of passwords.
* Removed subprocess, multiprocess, and threading libraries and rewrote corresponding code to use only _thread. Code is much simplified and should be more compatible with py2exe.
* Upgrade to Python 3.4
